# Software testing assignment
Practising planning and implementation of tests during COMP.SE.200 Software testing course.
Files for testing have been fetched from GitHub: https://github.com/otula/COMP.SE.200-2024-2025-1.git

The idea of this project was first to get familiar with the program what the course provided us and create a test plan for it which includes end-to-end scenarios and so on.
Based on the test plan, functional tests were created for the chosen files, test report and bug reports were done, CI/CD pipeline was done using GitHub Actions and the overall quality of the tested program was analysed. 

Test plan and test report can be found under /Docs folder. In those you can find more information about tests, results and analysis of the quality of the tested program.

Test plan was done in pairs but the actual implementation of tests and test report etc. was done by me.
